         <h2>Who am I ?</h2>
         <p id="intro">
            I am Sameera, a passionate photographer hailing from the picturesque island of Sri Lanka.
             My journey into the world of photography began as a child when I first held a camera and instantly fell in love with capturing the beauty that surrounds us.
        
            <br><br> 
            Over the years, my fascination with the natural world deepened, leading me to specialize in wildlife photography and the mesmerizing art of landscapes. With unwavering dedication and a lifelong commitment to my craft, I have followed my dreams to Melbourne, Australia, where I now operate my own photography studio.
            <br><br> 
            Through my lens, I strive to convey the profound connection between humanity and the awe-inspiring wonders of the world, sharing the magic of nature with all who view my work.
            <br><br>
            The aim of my lens is to:
            <br><br>
            <ol>
                <li>Conservation Through Photography</li><br>
                <li>Capturing the Essence of Landscapes</li><br>
                <li>Sharing Knowledge and Inspiring Others</li>
            </ol>
         
        </p>

                    <h3>How it started</h3>
                    <p id="paraleft">
                        It all began on a sunny day in the vibrant coastal town of Galle, Sri Lanka, where Sameera's fascination with photography was sparked by an old, weathered camera handed down from his grandfather. As a wide-eyed child, he was enchanted by the simple act of capturing moments in time. His first subjects were the colorful birds that flitted through his garden and the breathtaking sunsets over the Indian Ocean. It was as if he had found a portal to another world, one filled with endless possibilities and stories waiting to be told through the click of a shutter. With each snapshot, his passion for photography grew, and he knew he had found his calling.
                        <br><br>
                        His journey continued beyond Sri Lanka's borders, taking him to remote corners of the globe where he encountered breathtaking landscapes and fascinating wildlife, solidifying his commitment to a lifelong pursuit of photography. Today, Sameera's journey has led him to establish his own studio in Melbourne, Australia, where he continues to capture the essence of the natural world, one frame at a time.
